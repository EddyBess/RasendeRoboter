# Rasende Roboter 

## Overview
The game lets you play Rasende Roboter.

To launch the game, run the menu.py file.

To search for a solution using AI, press the AI button.

The AI used is a graph traversal algorithm called Breadth First Search.

You'll need to wait at least twenty minutes if the solution requires more than 6 moves.

To play, enter your number of moves in the box provided.

Please note that the numbers you enter won't work if you're using a numeric keypad.

There are a few errors, notably in the way the AI displays the solution.


## Comments

This project is not my most complete Python project. Indeed the goal of this project was more about learning graph traversal algorithm such as BFS oder A*.

It can be improve and will problably be when more freetime available
This project needs to be improved.

Possible AI improving techiques :
  -  Q-Learning
  -  Deep-Q-Learning
